# WEBPY
This is an application in Python that performs Sentiment Analysis of tweets in real-time. 
The user (that's you!) can enter hashtags or keywords and the app will stream relevant tweets and automatically classify them as positive, negative or neutral. It will also render the data in the form of graphs and charts using Python's matplotlib library.
It uses Web.py to render it in the form of a webpage.
